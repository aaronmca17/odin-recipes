    <p class="lasagna">
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Ground meat</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps on how to make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in salted water according to the package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet, cook ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination) over medium heat until browned. Add marinara or tomato sauce and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, seasoning with salt, pepper, and herbs like oregano or basil.</li>
        <li>Mix the ricotta filling: In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, salt, pepper, and any desired herbs (such as parsley or basil). This will be your cheesy layer.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagne: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom. Then, layer the cooked noodles on top, followed by more sauce, a layer of ricotta mixture, and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, finishing with a top layer of noodles, sauce, and mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Bake: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the lasagna for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
